# SpikingTravelingWave

Folder "Spiking": Generlized PyTorch based spiking neural network architecture. 
                  Quick Tutorial: 1. In a [projectname]Args.py (see template), specify a) Neuron groups b) Connections/synapses with Learning rule  c)Neuro-modulator, in lists of dicts.
                                  2. Call Network(NeuArgs, SynArgs) and run it by Network.step()

Folder "Rank coding" including RankArgs.py and notebook for simulation and data generation
